# dropwizard-what-to-do
This is a simple example app using dropwizard and hibernate to manage todo lists via api calls. 


## Prerequisites:

Make sure you have already 

* docker installed
* curl installed
* a running unix shell

## Setup

To build and create example data run the following in a shell:
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/nstoya/dropwizard-what-to-do.git
    $ cd dropwizard-what-to-do
    $ ./start.sh
    
## Start

Start the application via

    $ docker-compose up
  
The application should be running on http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to send requests. There is already some sample data.

    $ curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/todos' --header 'Authorization: Bearer test-token'
    
If everything is fine you should get:

    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Vor dem Urlaub",
            "description": "Vor Reiseantritt",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Gültigkeit Reisepässe"
                },
                {
                    "id": 3,
                    "name": "Gepäckbestimmungen",
                    "description": "für Lufthansa"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Vor Abreise",
            "description": "Am Tag selbst",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "id": 5,
                    "name": "Müll entsorgen"
                },
                {
                    "id": 6,
                    "name": "Stecker ziehen"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    
## Authentication

To use the application you need to authenticate. The application uses OAuth 2.0 for this purpose. For every request a valid
Berarer token must be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request. Since this is an example application only 
one user exists. The needed token is configured in the config-prod.yml file in the property `authToken`.

If the token is not valid a http 401 (Unauthorized) error code is returned.

## Endpoints

## Paging And Total Count

 Retrieving data may result in a high number of entries. That is why the results are capped to a default of 100 in
  several pages. The number of the first page is  which is also the page default. The pageSize default is 100. It can
   be set to the maximum value of 1000. 
   
Information about paging and total count is provided in the `Link` and `X-Total-Count` headers.
   
The paging parameters are as follows:
   
| Name  | Type  | Value type |
|---|---|---|
| page  | query   | int |  
| page_size  | query  | int |

Example: 

    curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/todos?page=2&page_size=7' --header 'Authorization: Bearer test-token'

## Further work

* Provide search
* CRUD endpoints for tasks
* Paging for tasks
* Move authentication data to DB
    * User table
    * todos per user
    * Endpoint POST /user for creating new user 
    * endpoint POST /token to get the Bearer token
* Generate entity classes from dropwizard migration files or hibernate mappings
* use https
* handle CORS
