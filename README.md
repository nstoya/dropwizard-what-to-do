# dropwizard-what-to-do
This is a simple example app using dropwizard and hibernate to manage todo lists via api calls. 

## Getting started

What you need:

* docker installed
* an sh shell

Checkout the project
 
    git clone https://github.com/nstoya/dropwizard-what-to-do.git
    
Build and prepare:

    run script
    
Run

    cd directory
    docker-compose up
    
## Authentication

To use the application you need to authenticate. The application uses OAuth 2.0 for this purpose. For every request a valid
Berarer token must be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request. Since this is an example application only 
one user exists. The needed token is configured in the config-prod.yml file in the property `authToken`.

If the token is not valid a http 401 (Unauthorized) error code is returned.

## Error Codes
